## Grand Opening Today!

So this is the very first but definately not last post of my blog. This blog will be around Ruby programming, web design and Ops automation. 

Beside those topics I drop in anything else I found useful, interesting or funny.  

Why do I call it Ops automation rather than DevOps? Well I think if done correctly there is nearly no need for operations.

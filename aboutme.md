My name is Kimmo Hintikka. I am born in Finland, but you can usually find in Dublin or somewhere else in Europe.

I build stuff with Ruby and write here how it all works out for.

When I am not writing code or creating solution designs in my day job at IBM SoftLayer, 
I go running, bouldering or enjoy good pint of beer with friends. 

Professional enquiries drop me a mail or message trough Linkedin.
